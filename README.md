# Volcanic Eruption Prediction

This project is in fulfillment of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineering Capstone Project.

This [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe/overview) competition was launched by Italyâ€™s Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) which focuses on geophysics and volcanology. The institute monitors seismic and volcanic activity all over the country.

The following files contain the steps into which the model was created;
+ EDA and Feature Extraction.ipynb: shows some exploratory data analysis and pre-processing steps before training the model. This can be run on your local computer with Python.
+ Model training.ipynb: shows the model training, evaluation and predictions for the competition. This can be run on AWS SageMaker.
+ Volcano.pdf: project report
